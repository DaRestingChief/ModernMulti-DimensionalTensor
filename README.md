# ModernMulti-DimensionalTensor
A lightweight C++ implementation of an n-dimensional Tensor data structure. Stores data in a 1D array with index mapping for multi-dimensional access. Supports creation, element access, reshape, and basic arithmetic operations. Demonstrates practical use of arrays and memory-efficient data structures.
